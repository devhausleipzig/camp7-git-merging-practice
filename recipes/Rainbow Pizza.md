## Preparation

1. Start with preparing the **dough** in order to let it rest before baking it crispy. Take a bowl and add all dry ingredients together and stir them. Then take the yeast and add one table spoon water and stir it as well. Set it aside for 10 minutes. It should react and create some bubbles. Pour the yeast into the bowl, start kneading and add some water from time to time until the dough has a sticky and smooth consistency. 
2. Put a towel over your bowl and store it for one hour somewhere warm.
3. Now start chopping all vegetables for **the spread**. Cut them into cubes and set them aside.
4. Watch one of your favourite shows.
5. Check your dough, it shpuld have doubled in size. Cute it in half and start rolling it out on a tray lined with parchment paper. 
6. Add tomato sauce, oregano, pepper and salt. Spread the cheese evenly and line the cut vegetables one by one on the dough.
7. Put your pizza into the oven for 30 minutes at 180 Â°C.
8. *Cut into pieces and enjoy!*
