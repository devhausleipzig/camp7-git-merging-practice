# *Khayali Pulaav* or Dreamy Rice

This Indian recipe is every child's (read *Dummy*) favorite in India. It is a great one, because parents are never involved in preparing this dish at all. Children can just make it all by themselves. To quote [Khalid Sheik](https://www.quora.com/profile/%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%BC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B2%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A6-%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%BC-Khalid-Sheikh) - a Quora user

## Instructions

- Go to any Asian restaurant near you, and order some Thai Noodles from there. It does not matter whether the restaurant is Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean or actually Thai! Till the time they have *Lassi* in their drinking menu, you can trust it for their authentic flavors. Take the Thai Noodles to go. 

  At home, you need to first prepare the lemons! Pick out the 3 Lemon slices that are used as decoration on top of the noodles. Throw the rest of the noodles away, because they anyways taste shit.

- Peel and Chop the onion in large thin slices. 

- Inform your neighbours to never check upon you in case of an accident. Why? Just because. Amazon is anyways doing that.

- Put the ***Empty*** pressure cooker on the fire stove. Close the lid tightly.

- Umm, wait and watch? In the meantime, maybe check out the [[Overview]]
