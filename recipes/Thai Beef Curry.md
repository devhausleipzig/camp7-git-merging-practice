# Thai Beef Curry

![Thai Curry image](https://marionskitchen.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Thai-beefpumpkin-red-curry2-e1552877952352.jpg)

I came across this recipe on the subreddit [slowcooking](https://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking). It's great with any type of meat and even without. Put whichever veggies in that strike your fancy. As long as you get the base right, you're golden. I have made this recipe countless times and can never quite say no to a second serving.

## Ingredients
| Amount | Ingredient|
|:-:|-|
| 75 g / 2 ¾ oz | Thai red curry paste*|     
| 175 ml / 6 fl oz | unsweetened coconut milk|
| 50 g / 1 3/4 oz | soft dark brown sugar**|
| 1 tbsp | Thai fish sauce|
| 75 g / 2 ¾ oz | smooth peanut butter|
| 900 g / 2lb | chuck steak, cut into 2.5cm / 1-inch dice|
| 2 | potatoes, diced|
| 125 ml / 4 fl oz | beef stock or water|
| | fresh basil leaves, cut into ribbons, to garnish|
| | steamed rice, to serve|

*\*You might need to adjust the amount of curry paste depending on the brand and your prefered spiciness level.*

*\*\*You will need to look for this in an Asian supermarket. Germans don't have the right brown sugar. It should feel and look like wet sand.*

## Steps
1.  Put the curry paste, coconut milk, sugar, fish sauce and peanut butter into the slow cooker and stir to combine. Add the beef, potatoes and stock and stir to coat in the mixture.
    
2.  Cover and cook on high for about 4 hours or on low for 8 hours, then set the lid slightly ajar and cook for a further 1 hour, or until the beef is very tender and the sauce has thickened slightly. Serve hot, garnished with basil, with the steamed rice.
3. Enjoy!
