*** 
## Ingredients

-   1 and 1/2 cups all purpose flour
-   3/4 cup brown sugar
-   1 tsp baking soda
-   1/3 cup cocoa powder (dutch process if you have it)
-   1/2 tsp salt
-   1 cup red wine
-   1/4 cup water
-   1/2 cup coconut oil, melted
-   2 TBS white vinegar
-   1 tsp vanilla extract

## Preparation

1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9 inch cake pan with parchment paper (cutting a circular shape in the paper will help with this).
2. Add your flour, sugar, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt to a large bowl and combine until no clumps remain. Add red wine, water, melted oil, vinegar, and vanilla to a small bowl. Combine wet with dry and mix until no dry parts remain (try not to over mix). Pour batter into lined cake pan and bake for 30 minutes. Check at this point to see if an inserted toothpick comes out clean. If there are minimal crumbs sticking to the pin, your cake is done! If your cake seems loose or wet on top, bake for a few more minutes and test again. Let cool fully in the pan (until no longer warm to the touch) and invert onto a plate.
3. While your cake is cooling, begin preparing your toppings. Add red wine and sugar to a sealed container and shake to combine. Add raspberries and let soak for at least 15 minutes to soak up flavor.
4. *Slice your cake, share and enjoy!*
