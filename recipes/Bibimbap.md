# Bibimbap

![Bibimbap](images/bibimbap.png)

Okay, so honestly, if you haven't had Korean food, you haven't lived. If there is one thing Koreans get right, it's got to be food. Their culture heavily focuses on community: Getting together with family and friends and having a nice meal.

Bimibap is ideal for using up leftover veggies. You can mix and match however you see fit. There's different meats, meat substitutes and multiple sauces you can try out to find the right version for you.  My favorite sauce is the [[Gochujang Bibimbap Sauce]]. And if you can't decide on which meat to use, I wholeheartedly recommend this [[Chicken Bulgogi]] recipe.
